<h3>Project 5<h3>
  <p> My Quiz App , 
The questions come randomly from a class structure we keep behind. If the user does not answer the question within the specified time, it is considered incorrect.
If the user lost at the end of the quiz, we can give a chance to play again. If the user wins, the application gives a congratulatory message to the user. </p>
